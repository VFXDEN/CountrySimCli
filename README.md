    Most stats are customizable. *other than factors of randomization*

    - unistd.h
    - iostream
    - stdlib.h
    - random
    - ctime

## Build instructions
  ### You have **2 Options** for how to install it

    - Use the unix executable file. (I have no clue if it will work on your computer)
    - Idk build it yourself

  ## Support
  ### Currently supporting
    - macOS
    - LINUX
  I will most likely not bring support to Windows as I do not have a way to test if it works.
