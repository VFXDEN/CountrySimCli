# CountrySimCli
  ## Tiny simulation where countries fight.
    Most stats are customizable. *other than factors of randomization*

  ## Dependencies
    - **unistd.h**
    - **iostream**
    - **stdlib.h**

## Build instructions
  ### You have **2 Options** for how to install it

    - Use the unix executable file. _I have no clue if it will work on your computer_
    - Idk build it yourself

  ## Support
  ### Currently supporting
    - macOS
    - LINUX
  I will most likely not bring support to Windows as I do not have a way to test if it works.
